        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I'm a second year PhD student in <a href = "http://ml.gatech.edu/">Machine Learning</a> at the <a href = "http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. I graduated in May 2018 with my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from the <a href = "http://ku.edu/">University of Kansas</a> with a focus in optimization and signal processing. I'm fortunate to be co-advised by <a href = "http://lf.gatech.edu/">Dr. Morris Cohen</a> and <a href = "http://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/">Dr. Mark Davenport</a>. My current research is focused on driving the state of the art in space weather forecasting using a mix of canonical time series methods as well as new machine learning methods, such as recurrent neural networks.</p>

        <p>Aside from research, I engage in a number of extracurricular activities. I am heavily involved in the musician's network on Georgia Tech's campus, and I play guitar in an indie rock/pop band. We have had the opportunity to play original music at different venues in Atlanta.<p>
