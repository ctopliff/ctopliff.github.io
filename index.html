        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I'm a third year PhD student in <a href = "http://ml.gatech.edu/">Machine Learning</a> at the <a href = "http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. I'm fortunate to be co-advised by <a href = "http://lf.gatech.edu/">Dr. Morris Cohen</a> and <a href = "http://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/">Dr. Mark Davenport</a>, and I'm happy to annouce that I am currently supported by the <a href = "https://ndseg.asee.org/about_ndseg">NDSEG Fellowship</a>. </p>
        <p>I graduated in May 2018 with my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from the <a href = "http://ku.edu/">University of Kansas</a>. I was exposed to applied statistics, optimization, and linear algebra early on during research positions in radar signal processing. I was also very lucky to do research internships at <a href = "http://www.stresearch.com/">Systems & Technology Research</a> (last time I checked, I was still on the front page!). </p>
          
        <!--<p>My research is focused around applying a mix of canonical and modern time series and machine learning methods to forecasting problems. One example is the application of Long short-term memory networks to forecasting magnetic activity which could have catastrophic effects for ground systems. I am also interested in explainability in machine learning. In particular, i'm interested in drawing conclusions from ML results that motivate decision making by people who are otherwise unfamiliar with machine learning.</p>-->
        <p>My research is focused on using canonical statistical methods and modern machine learning methods in applications with sequential data. One example is the application of LSTMs and Autoencoders to forecasting magnetic activity at earth which is driven by processes at the sun. </p>
