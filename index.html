        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I'm a second year PhD student in <a href = "http://ml.gatech.edu/">Machine Learning</a> at the <a href = "http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. I graduated in May 2018 with my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from the <a href = "http://ku.edu/">University of Kansas</a> with a focus in optimization and signal processing. I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href = "http://lf.gatech.edu/">Dr. Morris Cohen</a> and <a href = "http://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/">Dr. Mark Davenport</a>. My current research is focused on driving the state of the art in space weather forecasting using a mix of canonical time series methods as well as new machine learning methods, such as recurrent neural networks.</p>

        <p>Aside from research, I engage in a number of extracurricular activities. I am heavily involved in the Musician's Network on Georgia Tech's campus, and I play guitar in an indie rock/pop band. We have been lucky to play original music at different venues in Atlanta.<p>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>
